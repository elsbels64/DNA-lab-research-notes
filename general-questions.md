- how would you recommend learning how to do good documentation?
-----  keep a lab notebook. have a record of all the commands you've run. because we're going to have to know how everything was generated when we write a paper.
  - short comments with every command that's been run with short comments for every file that's in there
  - comment stuff out if things don't work with an explaination of why it didn't work

- would you rather we write the code ourselves for pileup filter or find a prewritten code
