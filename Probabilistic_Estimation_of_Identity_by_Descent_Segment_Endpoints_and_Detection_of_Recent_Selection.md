unbiased estimates of IBD segment endpoints

If the genome were completely neutral, and there are no biases in detecting IBD segments or estimating their centiMorgan (cM) lengths, the expected number of IBD segments exceeding some cM length threshold would be constant across the genome. In contrast, if certain haplotypes in a genomic region have a selective advantage, the effective size of the population is reduced in that region, which leads to a higher than expected number of IBD segments. IBD-based tests can also detect the effects of negative selection and balancing selection, since any type of selection will tend to decrease the effective population size within the genomic region.

Effective population size (Ne): The number of individuals in an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift as the actual population. Selection reduces this locally.
</br>Balancing selection: When multiple variants are maintained in a population (unlike positive selection where one variant sweeps to high frequency). Example: sickle cell trait, where having one copy protects against malaria.
